# BenchBot Batch

BenchBot batches is a set of environment lists used in both development, and challenge evaluation. The files allow easy replication of a static list of environments, which can be used with:
- the `-E` argument of the `benchbot_batch` script (from the [BenchBot software stack](https://github.com/RoboticVisionOrg/benchbot)) when autonomously running a submission through multiple environments,
- evaluation to require a certain set of environments TODO.
